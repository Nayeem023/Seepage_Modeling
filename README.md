# Seepage_Modeling
- Developed and implemented a seepage modeling approach using the FAM (Finite Approximate Method) package to simulate groundwater flow and seepage behavior in complex geotechnical systems.
- Modeled seepage conditions for various civil engineering projects, including dams, levees, and embankments, ensuring accurate flow predictions for water management and structural stability analysis.
- Discretized complex geological domains into finite elements and applied boundary conditions such as constant head, no-flow, and flux for precise numerical solutions
